### Finished:

1. Styling
2. Mobile styling
3. Rendering all bookmarks
4. Dark mode styling
5. Placeholder components - create, edit bookmarks + user login page

### Known issues:

1. Read only
2. Create, edit, delete does not work
3. User auth is not active
4. Login page can only be accessed with "/user" - inactive until user auth can be done
5. "Add New Bookmark" does not create a form yet - the form stays on top (does not function)

### To do:

1. Add create, edit, delete functionality
2. useState to display user auth failure messages

### Extended goal

1. Reordering bookmarks
2. Switch for light/dark modes
